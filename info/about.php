<p>
Welcome to Vicspace, the online portal composed of salacious gossip and stalks in Victoria!
<br />
Don't hold back! Go right ahead, sign up and start posting pictures of what or more rather; who you saw today!

You know you want to...
<p><font size="2>
The idea to develop this website was inspired by many factors, majorly from the "Vent you Spleen" section of the 'Daily Mx' and various other facebook stalker-space groups.
<br />
This website differs from most if not all social web sites in that everything you post, comment, or upload is visible to the public. You do not require a cumbersome allowed list of personnel to share your experiences and encounters.
<br />
Registration is completely free and open to and for the public.
